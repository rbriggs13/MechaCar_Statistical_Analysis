## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![deliverable1results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87343629/145211531-9aa477b3-edf0-4331-949e-07babed8d0f7.png)

The vehicle length and ground clearance both provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values, while the other variables do not, because of this the slope of the linear model will not be zero.
Due to the fact that there is a non random amount of variance and the size of the p-value the linear model should effectively predict the mpg of the prototype.
