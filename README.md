## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![deliverable1results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87343629/145211531-9aa477b3-edf0-4331-949e-07babed8d0f7.png)

The vehicle length and ground clearance both provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values, while the other variables do not, because of this the slope of the linear model will not be zero.
Due to the fact that there is a non random amount of variance and the size of the p-value the linear model should effectively predict the mpg of the prototype.

These summaries clearly indicate that in total as well as lots 1 and 2 meet the requirement that the variance must not exceed 100. Lot 3 on the other hand does not meet this expectation at all and is drastically affecting the numbers for the total considering that lot 1 and 2 have very low variance.
